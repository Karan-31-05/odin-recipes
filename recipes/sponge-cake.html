        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>

        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>

        <li>Once cooled, spread jam or whipped cream between the layers if desired. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>
